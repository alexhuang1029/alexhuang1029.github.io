The Hamilton Library in Chandler, Arizona was buzzing with excitement several weeks ago as it hosted the final meeting of "Operation FIRST," a six-week program from July to August. Operation FIRST was organized by the Hamilton Microbots, Team 698, the local FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) robotics team from Hamilton High School (Chandler, AZ). The event, aimed at sparking interest in robotics/STEM among young students, was hailed as a tremendous success by attendees, organizers, and community members alike.

The curriculum featured a variety of engaging activities, including showcases of robotics demonstrations, hands-on workshops, and open lesson plans. The Hamilton Microbots, known for their innovative approach to STEM education, designed the event to inspire the next generation of engineers, coders, and technicians.

“We wanted to create an event that was not only educational but also fun and engaging for everyone,” said Rahul Kalikota, the president of the Hamilton Microbots. “Seeing the smiles on the kids' faces and their excitement when they got to 3-D print their own designs or finally figure out a specific aspect of programming was incredibly rewarding.”

Participants had the chance to try their hand at engineering challenges, like the marshmallow tower challenge and 2017 FRC game speed-design challenge, as well as a choice to learn about CAD (computer-aided design) or Programming. The unique challenges aimed to demonstrate that the world of FRC Robotics is not just about following instructions but also about innovation and thinking outside the box.

“I successfully learn the basics of Java and how to create loops and if statements in Java,” claimed one participant in the Programming department.

“Operation FIRST allowed me to dive into the basics of CAD, like sketching and extruding, and now I can design my own projects to solve problems I run into everyday!” exclaimed another, one in the CAD department.

“I love the donuts and snacks they brought!” was the response of another happy attendee.

The Hamilton Microbots also took the opportunity to recruit new members, encouraging students interested in robotics, engineering, or even marketing and graphic design to join their team. The event’s success has already resulted in an influx of new recruits eager to be a part of the club’s future.

“We are thrilled with the turnout and the enthusiasm from the community,” Chandler librarian Thuan Nguyen agreed. As one of the longtime librarians at Hamilton, he truly believed that Operation FIRST was “a huge success,” and he looks forward to hosting more events like this to “continue fostering a love for STEM in our community”.

As the event wrapped up, it was clear that Operation FIRST had achieved its goal of inspiring curiosity and enthusiasm for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. With plans already in motion for next year's events, the Hamilton Library and the Hamilton Microbots are well on their way to making Operation FIRST an annual tradition that continues to inspire and educate.
